  Tribal Wars PHP Bot

<h3 align="center">
    A bot for the TribalWars game made with Lumen Framework.

## :exclamation: The concept of everything

I was thinking about going back to playing Tribal Wars after a few years without playing. But in those years that have passed, I learned to program. And if there's something I like to do, it's BOTS!<br>
The idea is to have the manual mode (where the player can execute all the actions via console) and the automatic mode (where a list of commands will be created to be executed every hour to build, recruit, farm and etc)

## :computer: Technologies

 chose to use Lumen because I work with the framework on a daily basis, so it makes a lot easier.

- Artisan Console<br>
Used to make the interface and display all the game data on the console. Basically the I/O of the application.
- Guzzle<br>
All the requests to the TribalWars API/Website are made with GuzzleHTTP, because is the most simple and organized PHP HTTP client which i know until now.

Ok, now let's install and try it.
